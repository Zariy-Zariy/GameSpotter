# GameSpotter
A website that allows you to know what to play when you are bored. You just answer a quiz and then games are sorted automatically to replay old classics or to discover new ones.

## How to run ?
After installing the latest version of python, simply clone the repository, open your terminal in the project root and execute:
```pip install flask``` (First time only)  
And then:  
```python app.py```  

## A database... Why ?
The Steam API is pretty slow, so the database is purely for caching.  

*This website is my CS50 final project (thanks Harvard !)*
